=====================

On 28th September, 2014, GDG New Delhi organized a Design Sprint along the theme of Solve for X. The goal was to get people of varying skill sets together and have them ideate on challenges faced by different people in India in every day life.

All of the work done by attendees will be provided for others to view and build upon, in the hope that at least a few are implemented by anyone, anywhere in the World, either in their original form or used as an inspiration.

Their work is currently being compiled and will be released soon.
