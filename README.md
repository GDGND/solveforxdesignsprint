Solve for X Design Sprint
=====================

On 28th September, 2014, GDG New Delhi organized a Design Sprint along the theme of Solve for X. The goal was to get people of varying skill sets together and have them ideate on challenges faced by different people in India in every day life.

All of the work done by attendees will be provided for others to view and build upon, in the hope that at least a few are implemented by anyone, anywhere in the World, either in their original form or used as an inspiration.

Personas
========================
There were a total of three personas suggested, by Google Developer Group New Delhi, GotStared.at (http://gotstared.at) and Haptik (https://haptik.co).

* GDG New Delhi proposed the persona of a young, middle school student in a Tier-2 city in India, who is excited about science and technology but does not have access to great educational material. She's interested in taking an initiative and learning on her own, but isn't yet comfortable exploring the web (which she has limited time for) on her own, nor does she have a mentor near her.

* GotStared.at proposed the persona of a young working woman in Noida from a middle class family who often faces harassment, eve-teasing and even molestation on her way to her office every day. The police in the city is difficult to approach, lacks sensitivity and typically does not take matters in their hands as they should.

*  Haptik proposed the persona of a cancer-stricken patient, whose treatment has been facing issues claiming her medical expenses from her insurer. The situation is causing enormous stress and also leaving her in debt.

Solutions
======================
#####GDG New Delhi
* Smart compression of vidoes from MOOC for faster transfer and lesser storage. Done by picking up key frames from video programmatically in addition to transcribing speech from MOOC, which can later be optionally put back to speech using TTS on the client side.
